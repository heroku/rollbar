rollbar
-------

`rollbar` is a Golang Rollbar client that makes it easy to report errors to
Rollbar with full stacktraces. Errors are sent to Rollbar asynchronously in a
background goroutine.

Because Go's `error` type doesn't include stack information from when it was set
or allocated, we use the stack information from where the error was reported.

Documentation
=============

[API docs on godoc.org](http://godoc.org/github.com/heroku/rollbar)

Usage
=====

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/stvp/rollbar"
)

func main() {
  rollbar.SetToken("MY_TOKEN")
  rollbar.SetEnvironment("production")                 // defaults to "development"
  rollbar.SetCodeVersion("v2")                         // optional Git hash/branch/tag (required for GitHub integration)
  rollbar.SetServerHost("web.1")                       // optional override; defaults to hostname
  rollbar.SetServerRoot("github.com/heroku/myproject") // path of project (required for GitHub integration and non-project stacktrace collapsing)

  result, err := DoSomething()
  if err != nil {
    rollbar.Error(rollbar.ERR, err)
  }

  rollbar.Message("info", "Message body goes here")

  rollbar.Wait()
}
```

Running Tests
=============

Set up a dummy project in Rollbar and pass the access token as an environment
variable to `go test`:

    TOKEN=f0df01587b8f76b2c217af34c479f9ea go test

And verify the reported errors manually.
